# Hola

Hi there, folks.

If you see this, then this package is still in it's early unfinished version. It
will handle some usual API message transporting some day, but it doesn't for
now. Only brave ones should use it in their projects. As soon as it is finished,
this message will be replaced with something more nice, real readme, for
example.
